Simply create a text file with lines that may use the following commands:

Example Program:
	read x
	y = x + 3
	print y
	print x

(This would ask the user for an input to assign to the variable x(say 6). Add 3 to that number(9). Output the number to the screen (9). And then Output the original number to the screen(6).
